Quincy Pet Shelter Database Project

Overview

This project consists of two key components:

SQL Schema & Data Dump: A structured SQL database for a pet adoption system.
PHP Application: A simple PHP web application that interacts with the database to display information about the pets, their medical history, adoption status, and other key details.
SQL Schema
The database khanab_DB contains the following tables:

ADOPTION: Tracks adoption details, including adoption date, pet ID, and owner ID.
MEDICAL: Stores medical services provided to pets, including the service name, date, veterinarian, and costs.
OWNER: Stores pet ownersâ€™ details, including name, contact information, and their preferences for pet adoption.
PET: Stores pet information, including name, breed, species, age, gender, size, arrival date, and health status.
The schema also defines several views for reporting:

Birth Date of Pets: Displays pet names, age, health status, species, and arrival date.
Breed with Highest Adoption Rate: Shows the breed with the highest adoption rate.
Medical Services on Pets in Date Order: Lists medical services performed on pets.
Pets Adopted Each Year: Shows pets adopted, their owners, and adoption dates.
Pets Not Adopted and Length of Stay: Lists pets still in the shelter and their length of stay.
Preferred Pet Match for Unadopted Pets: Matches unadopted pets with owners who have matching preferences.
PHP Web Application
The PHP component interacts with the database to display the following views:

Medical History of Pets: Displays pets' medical services, including service type and date.
Pets Not Adopted: Lists unadopted pets and their length of stay at the shelter.
Adopted/Returned Pets: Shows pets, their owners, adoption/return date, and current adoption status.
Pet Birth Dates: Displays pet birthdates, health status, species, and arrival dates.
Preferred Pet Matches: Lists unadopted pets and potential owner matches based on species preferences.
Breed Adoption Rates: Displays the breed with the highest adoption rate.

Installation Instructions

Database Setup:
Import the provided SQL dump file (khanab_DB.sql) into your MySQL server to create the database schema and populate it with initial data.

PHP Application Setup:
Modify the config.php file to update the database connection details (host, username, password, and database name).
Ensure the server supports PHP 7.x and MySQL 8.x.

Running the Application:
Open the web browser and navigate to the application URL (e.g., http://localhost/QuincyShelterDatabase) to view the pet adoption and medical data.

Dependencies
MySQL 8.0+
PHP 7.2+
